# PiCam1
Raspberry Pi Camera experiments

## Purpose

This is my experiments with the Raspberry Pi Camera.
At the end of it (although it will probably never end! :)) I hope to be able to do all sorts of fancy stuff with the camera including:
- Multiple streams
- Motion detection
- Still shots
- Web streaming
- Image processing
- etc.

The technologies I have decided to use are:
- Python
- VueJS
- Nginx
- Bootstrap

I want to learn how to do things properly -
which unfortunately means it will be more complicated than it needs to be -
this is to make sure there is a good separation of concerns (the fact I am using nginx hints that I am making it more complicated than it needs to be).
This is so I learn how to make scalable camera / python projects.

Sub-technologies that I will be using:
- Flask
- Swagger
